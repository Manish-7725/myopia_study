- [x] Update populateMetrics in admin_dash.js to fetch data from /api/admin/overview/ instead of using mockData.metrics
- [x] Map API response fields to HTML element IDs:
  - total_students -> totalStudents
  - total_followups -> totalFollowups
  - due_this_week -> todayEntries (assuming todayEntries represents followups due this week)
- [x] Note: totalUsers is not in the API response; keep using mockData.metrics.totalUsers for now
- [x] Handle API errors gracefully
